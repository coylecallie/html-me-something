            <h1>How I Started Painting</h1>
            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>I was always #italicize really into coloring books when I was a young girl. They passed the time and offered some sort of artistic relief that I was too young to recognize at the time. I was always experimenting with colors in preschool. I loved how something as simple as a different color could change the mood of a piece. Things changed when I was enrolled in Kindergarten. I met my biggest inspiration--Ms. Ingraham. She gave me nothing but unwavering support and offered me her own advice about my most recent work. And when I say work, I mean a random accumulation of scribbles and shapes. </p>

            <h2>Highschool</h2>
            <p>I continued honing my craft throughout the rest of my schooling. Mostly because I was very adament about being in art classes and always had a pencil and notebook handy. Things changed when I turned 16. I moved schools and cities. I experienced intense culture shock and poor self esteem which led me to recluse into my bedroom for the remainder of my high school years. Around that same time, I gathered up what cash I could and decided to buy paint and canvas. </p>

            <h2>Now</h2>
            <p>I took a step away from any creative outlet when I started college. It was not on purpose; I was very distracted with my education and love. After my relationship ended I immediately got back to my brushes and canvas. I painted like a fiend and also dabbled in some fiberwork and weaving. It felt #italisize so good. Since then, I have continued to piant regularly. I sell my work now and have a very small following. I am so grateful for this journey. </p>
